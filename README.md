Video Game Rental Website:
The main purpose of our web application is so user within cananda will be able to rent any video game they want for a very cheap price.

How OOP can be implemented:
- Polymorphisim: We can use polymorphisim to create mulitple video game references to replicate any Video games in a Video game series (Game one, Game Two , Game three ect. )  Buecase it is in series we can extented mulitple forms of one single games for video games that have a full series. 
- Encapsulation: There are some information that needs to remind private and can only be shared with certian users depending on their role. 
  for an exmaple, a developer of the website would have more access to certian vairables then others (examples cfredit card info would need to stay private since we dont want the customers to look at other customers credit card info.)
