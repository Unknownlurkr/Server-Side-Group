# Server-Side-Group
A repo for Server-Side Projects:
-Assignment One 

Just to store our code so we can make mistakes and fuck around with it if we need to and view our changes when in different locations. ( I will add you to the repo later
(Will create a repo later for when we submit the assignment and add her as a collaborator.)
